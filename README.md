# Local and Connect to Flywheel Site Search for Local by Flywheel

Adds a live fuzzy search to Local and Connect to Flywheel sites.

## Notes and Troubleshooting

- Currently this plugin only works on version 3.2.0 and above of Local, for Teams and for individuals with no team account.
- I've only tested this on a Mac so far. Please let me know if you're having issues on Windows or Linux in the Issues tab!
- If the Connected Sites search doesn't work at first, try toggling the add-on Off and back On, or restarting you Local instance.

## To Install (via repo):

1. Clone and extract this repo into `~/Library/Application Support/Local by Flywheel/addons` (or the equivalent on a Windows or PC).
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`, then `npm run build` to compile.
3. Restart Local
4. Enable the add-on in the Add-ons section (this will probably prompt you to restart Local).

## Development Helpers

At the end of the `src/renderer.jsx` file, there is a commented out section of code that looks like this:

~~~js
/**********************************************************
* Development Helpers
*/
const remote = context.electron.remote;
remote.getCurrentWindow().openDevTools();
window.reload = remote.getCurrentWebContents().reloadIgnoringCache;
~~~

This code is helpful for testing new code. It opens the JS Console in the Local app, and allows you to reload the app by running the `reload()` function in the console. Uncomment it to use it! This code was borrow from [this Delicious Brains article](https://deliciousbrains.com/creating-custom-addon-local-flywheel/).
